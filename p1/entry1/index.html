            <p> I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, </p>        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <p> but I understand that in the Gothic cathedral of the West, the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty.</p>        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <p>  There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible.</p>        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <p>   A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room.</p>        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="image1">
            <p> In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house.  </p>        </div>
        <div class="image1">
            <p>The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji- and the farmhouses of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their roofs give the impression of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eaves. </p>        </div> 
        <div class="image1">
            <p>Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible.</p>        </div> 
        <div class="image1">
            <p>Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the nobility and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye is the massive roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves.</p>        </div> 
        <div class="image1">
            <p>A roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built.</p>        </div>
